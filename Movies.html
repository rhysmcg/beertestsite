            <p class="lead"> Hiccup aims to unite the vikings and the dragons in order to bring peace on the island of Berk. However, he must stop the evil Grimmel and his devious plans to wipe out all dragons. Writer-director Dean DeBlois brings his wondrous Dragon trilogy to a spectacular finish with How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World. The third and final part of the story from DreamWorks Animation faced an uphill battle since the first sequel, in 2014, earned $40 million less than the $217 million take of the 2010 original. In Hollywood, the bottom line drives the big decisions, so Dragon 3 looked destined for the chopping block. But DeBlois persevered and you’ll be glad he did. The Hidden World is the best Dragon yet — an animated action phenom with moonstruck passion in its heart and a spirit that soars.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Shrek <span class="text-muted"> </span></h2>
            <p class="lead">Shrek is a 2001 American computer-animated comedy film loosely based on the 1990 fairytale picture book of the same name by William Steig. Directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson in their directorial debuts, it stars Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow as the voices of the lead characters. The film parodies other films adapted from fairy tale storylines, primarily aimed at animated Disney films. In the story, an ogre called Shrek (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt Lord Farquaad (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing Princess Fiona (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of Donkey (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Averngers Endgame <span class="text-muted"> Sequal to Infinity War</span></h2>
            <p class="lead">After Thanos, an intergalactic warlord, disintegrates half of the universe, the Avengers must reunite and assemble again to reinvigorate their trounced allies and restore balance. The Russo brothers' poignant, powerful finale more than lives up to the hype: It's a thrilling conclusion and a deeply emotional exploration of loss and love, duty and honor, friendship and family. Written by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story focuses on the remaining Avengers and their post-trauma lives. Each seems overwhelmed by their failure, so when they start to regroup, it's clear that they're far from the same confident, optimistic superheroes who thought they could defeat Thanos in Infinity War. The dads in the group are particularly effective at showing how personal the grief is, providing a contrast to the general sense of failure and loss that the single superheroes feel. As the often underappreciated Hawkeye, Renner stands out in a crowded field of immense talent for making his character feel central. His intensity and his platonic, brotherly love for Natasha/Black Widow is perfectly conveyed. Johansson does a lot of the emotionally resonant work in the movie, keeping tabs on everyone, encouraging her friends, and acting like everyone's favorite sister (except in the Hulk's case). The big three -- Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor -- are also fabulous. Their differences have never been more obvious, but each proves that despite past conflicts and heartbreaks, they're worthy and ready to fight side by side.</p>
